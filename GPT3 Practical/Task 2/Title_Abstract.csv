0,On the Cohomological Derivation of Yang-Mills Theory in the Antifield Formalism,"We present a brief review of the cohomological solutions of self-coupling interactions of the fields in the free Yang-Mills theory. All consistent interactions among the fields have been obtained using the antifield formalism through several order BRST deformations of the master equation. It is found that the coupling deformations halt exclusively at the second order, whereas higher order deformations are obstructed due to non-local interactions. The results demonstrate the BRST cohomological derivation of the interacting Yang-Mills theory."
1,Regularity of solutions of the isoperimetric problem that are close to a smooth manifold,"In this work we consider a question in the calculus of variations motivated by riemannian geometry, the isoperimetric problem. We show that solutions to the isoperimetric problem, close in the flat norm to a smooth submanifold, are themselves smooth and $C^{2,\alpha}$-close to the given sub manifold. We show also a version with variable metric on the manifold. The techniques used are, among other, the standards outils of linear elliptic analysis and comparison theorems of riemannian geometry, Allard's regularity theorem for minimizing varifolds, the isometric immersion theorem of Nash and a parametric version due to Gromov."
2,Asymptotic theory of least squares estimators for nearly unstable processes under strong dependence,"This paper considers the effect of least squares procedures for nearly unstable linear time series with strongly dependent innovations. Under a general framework and appropriate scaling, it is shown that ordinary least squares procedures converge to functionals of fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes. We use fractional integrated noise as an example to illustrate the important ideas. In this case, the functionals bear only formal analogy to those in the classical framework with uncorrelated innovations, with Wiener processes being replaced by fractional Brownian motions. It is also shown that limit theorems for the functionals involve nonstandard scaling and nonstandard limiting distributions. Results of this paper shed light on the asymptotic behavior of nearly unstable long-memory processes."
5,Weight Reduction for Mod l Bianchi Modular Forms,"Let K be an imaginary quadratic field with class number one and ring of integers O. We prove that mod l, a system of Hecke eigenvalues occurring in the first cohomology group of some congruence subgroup Gamma of SL(2,O) can be realized in the first cohomology with trivial coefficients after increasing the level of Gamma by l."
6,Nonequilibrium phase transition in a spreading process on a timeline,"We consider a nonequilibrium process on a timeline with discrete sites which evolves by a non-Markovian update rule in such a way that an active site at time t activates one or several sites in the future at time t+dt. The time intervals dt are distributed algebraically as dt^(-1-kappa), where 0<kappa<1 is a control paramter. Depending on the activation rate, the system display a nonequilibrium phase transition which may be interpreted as directed percolation transition driven by temporal Levy flights in the limit of zero space dimensions. The critical properties are investigated by extensive numerical simulations and compared with field-theoretic predictions."
8,Quantum integrable systems in three-dimensional magnetic fields: the Cartesian case,"In this paper we construct integrable three-dimensional quantum-mechanical systems with magnetic fields, admitting pairs of commuting second-order integrals of motion. The case of Cartesian coordinates is considered. Most of the systems obtained are new and not related to the separation of variables in the corresponding Schr\""odinger equation."
9,Numerical Performance of Compact Fourth Order Formulation of the Navier-Stokes Equations,"In this study the numerical performance of the fourth order compact formulation of the steady 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations introduced by Erturk et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 50, 421-436) will be presented. The benchmark driven cavity flow problem will be solved using the introduced compact fourth order formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with two different line iterative semi-implicit methods for both second and fourth order spatial accuracy. The extra CPU work needed for increasing the spatial accuracy from second order (O(x2)) to fourth order (O(x4)) formulation will be presented."
10,Some Subtle Concepts in Fundamental Physics,"In this paper, we discuss some subtle concepts, such as coordinate, measurement, simultaneity, Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction, singularity in fundamental physics. The explanations of these concepts in textbooks are usually incomplete and lead to puzzles. Some long-standing paradoxes such as the Ehrenfest one are caused by misinterpretation of these concepts. The analysis shows these concepts all have simple and naive meanings, and can be well understood using suitable logical procedure. The discussion may shed light on some famous paradoxes, and provide some new insights into the structure and features of a promising unified field theory."
11,Bayesian reasoning in cosmology,"We discuss epistemological and methodological aspects of the Bayesian approach in astrophysics and cosmology. The introduction to the Bayesian framework is given for a further discussion concerning the Bayesian inference in physics. The interplay between the modern cosmology, Bayesian statistics, and philosophy of science is presented. We consider paradoxes of confirmation, like Goodman's paradox, appearing in the Bayesian theory of confirmation. As in Goodman's paradox the Bayesian inference is susceptible to some epistemic limitations in the logic of induction. However Goodman's paradox applied to cosmological hypotheses seems to be resolved due to the evolutionary character of cosmology and accumulation new empirical evidences. We argue that the Bayesian framework is useful in the context of falsificability of quantum cosmological models, as well as contemporary dark energy and dark matter problem."
12,Linear Operators and Operator Functions Associated with Spectral   Boundary Value Problems,"The paper develops a theory of spectral boundary value problems from the perspective of general theory of linear operators in Hilbert spaces. An abstract form of spectral boundary value problem with generalized boundary conditions is suggested and results on its solvability complemented by representations of weak and strong solutions are obtained. Existence of a closed linear operator defined by a given boundary condition and description of its domain are studied in detail. These questions are addressed on the basis of Krein's resolvent formula derived from the explicit representations of solutions also obtained here. Usual resolvent identities for two operators associated with two different boundary conditions are written in terms of the so called M-function. Abstract considerations are complemented by illustrative examples taken from the theory of partial differential operators. Other applications to boundary value problems of analysis and mathematical physics are outlined. (Initial version title ""Spectral Boundary Value Problems and their Linear Operators"", 2009)"
13,Anomalous scaling due to correlations: Limit theorems and self-similar processes,"We derive theorems which outline explicit mechanisms by which anomalous scaling for the probability density function of the sum of many correlated random variables asymptotically prevails. The results characterize general anomalous scaling forms, justify their universal character, and specify universality domains in the spaces of joint probability density functions of the summand variables. These density functions are assumed to be invariant under arbitrary permutations of their arguments. Examples from the theory of critical phenomena are discussed. The novel notion of stability implied by the limit theorems also allows us to define sequences of random variables whose sum satisfies anomalous scaling for any finite number of summands. If regarded as developing in time, the stochastic processes described by these variables are non-Markovian generalizations of Gaussian processes with uncorrelated increments, and provide, e.g., explicit realizations of a recently proposed model of index evolution in finance."
15,Synchronization of spatio-temporal chaos as an absorbing phase transition: a study in 2+1 dimensions,"The synchronization transition between two coupled replicas of spatio-temporal chaotic systems in 2+1 dimensions is studied as a phase transition into an absorbing state - the synchronized state. Confirming the scenario drawn in 1+1 dimensional systems, the transition is found to belong to two different universality classes - Multiplicative Noise (MN) and Directed Percolation (DP) - depending on the linear or nonlinear character of damage spreading occurring in the coupled systems. By comparing coupled map lattice with two different stochastic models, accurate numerical estimates for MN in 2+1 dimensions are obtained. Finally, aiming to pave the way for future experimental studies, slightly non-identical replicas have been considered. It is shown that the presence of small differences between the dynamics of the two replicas acts as an external field in the context of absorbing phase transitions, and can be characterized in terms of a suitable critical exponent."
16,Tracking Dynamics of Two-Dimensional Continuous Attractor Neural Networks,"We introduce an analytically solvable model of two-dimensional continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). The synaptic input and the neuronal response form Gaussian bumps in the absence of external stimuli, and enable the network to track external stimuli by its translational displacement in the two-dimensional space. Basis functions of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator in polar coordinates are introduced to describe the distortion modes of the Gaussian bump. The perturbative method is applied to analyze its dynamics. Testing the method by considering the network behavior when the external stimulus abruptly changes its position, we obtain results of the reaction time and the amplitudes of various distortion modes, with excellent agreement with simulation results."
17,Eigenvalue method to compute the largest relaxation time of disordered systems,"We consider the dynamics of finite-size disordered systems as defined by a master equation satisfying detailed balance. The master equation can be mapped onto a Schr\""odinger equation in configuration space, where the quantum Hamiltonian $H$ has the generic form of an Anderson localization tight-binding model. The largest relaxation time $t_{eq}$ governing the convergence towards Boltzmann equilibrium is determined by the lowest non-vanishing eigenvalue $E_1=1/t_{eq}$ of $H$ (the lowest eigenvalue being $E_0=0$). So the relaxation time $t_{eq}$ can be computed {\it without simulating the dynamics} by any eigenvalue method able to compute the first excited energy $E_1$. Here we use the 'conjugate gradient' method to determine $E_1$ in each disordered sample and present numerical results on the statistics of the relaxation time $t_{eq}$ over the disordered samples of a given size for two models : (i) for the random walk in a self-affine potential of Hurst exponent $H$ on a two-dimensional square of size $L  imes L$, we find the activated scaling $\ln t_{eq}(L) \sim L^{\psi}$ with $\psi=H$ as expected; (ii) for the dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model of $N$ spins, we find the growth $\ln t_{eq}(N) \sim N^{\psi}$ with $\psi=1/3$ in agreement with most previous Monte-Carlo measures. In addition, we find that the rescaled distribution of $(\ln t_{eq})$ decays as $e^{- u^{\eta}}$ for large $u$ with a tail exponent of order $\eta \simeq 1.36$. We give a rare-event interpretation of this value, that points towards a sample-to-sample fluctuation exponent of order $\psi_{width} \simeq 0.26$ for the barrier."
18,Boundedness results for finite flat group schemes over discrete valuation rings of mixed characteristic,"Let $p$ be a prime. Let $V$ be a discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ and index of ramification $e$. Let $f: G  ightarrow H$ be a homomorphism of finite flat commutative group schemes of $p$ power order over $V$ whose generic fiber is an isomorphism. We provide a new proof of a result of Bondarko and Liu that bounds the kernel and the cokernel of the special fiber of $f$ in terms of $e$. For $e < p-1$ this reproves a result of Raynaud. Our bounds are sharper that the ones of Liu, are almost as sharp as the ones of Bondarko, and involve a very simple and short method. As an application we obtain a new proof of an extension theorem for homomorphisms of truncated Barsotti--Tate groups which strengthens Tate's extension theorem for homomorphisms of $p$-divisible groups."
19,An alternative approach to determining average distance in a class of scale-free modular networks,"Various real-life networks of current interest are simultaneously scale-free and modular. Here we study analytically the average distance in a class of deterministically growing scale-free modular networks. By virtue of the recursive relations derived from the self-similar structure of the networks, we compute rigorously this important quantity, obtaining an explicit closed-form solution, which recovers the previous result and is corroborated by extensive numerical calculations. The obtained exact expression shows that the average distance scales logarithmically with the number of nodes in the networks, indicating an existence of small-world behavior. We present that this small-world phenomenon comes from the peculiar architecture of the network family."
20,Impurity-induced shocks in the asymmetric exclusion process with long-range hopping,"We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on the periodic chain in the presence of a single impurity site that is inaccessible to other particles and therefore acts as a static defect. Particles are allowed to advance any distance l \geq 1 on the right with the probability that decays as l^-(1+sigma), where sigma > 1. Despite the long range of hopping, we find the same type of phase transition that occurs in the standard short-range TASEP with a defect site where defect induces a macroscopic shock in the stationary state. In particular, our model displays two main features characteristic of the short-range TASEP with defect site: a growth of the shock width with system size L as L^(1/2) or L^(1/3), depending on the existence of the particle-hole symmetry, and the power-law decay in density profiles of the shock phase. However, unlike the profiles in the short-range case, we find that the latter are well reproduced by the mean-field approximation, which enables us to derive the analytical expression for sigma-dependent exponent nu = sigma-1 of this power-law decay and the point sigma_c = 4/3 at which the transition takes place."
21,Triangulated categories of mixed motives,"This book discusses the construction of triangulated categories of mixed motives over a noetherian scheme of finite dimension, extending Voevodsky's definition of motives over a field. In particular, it is shown that motives with rational coefficients satisfy the formalism of the six operations of Grothendieck. This is achieved by studying descent properties of motives, as well as by comparing different presentations of these categories, following and extending insights and constructions of Deligne, Beilinson, Bloch, Thomason, Gabber, Levine, Morel, Voevodsky, Ayoub, Spitzweck, R\""ondigs, {\O}stv{\ae}r, and others. In particular, the relation of motives with $K$-theory is addressed in full, and we prove the absolute purity theorem with rational coefficients, using Quillen's localization theorem in algebraic $K$-theory together with a variation on the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem. Using resolution of singularities via alterations of de Jong-Gabber, this leads to a version of Grothendieck-Verdier duality for constructible motivic sheaves with rational coefficients over rather general base schemes. We also study versions with integral coefficients, constructed via sheaves with transfers, for which we obtain partial results. Finally, we associate to any mixed Weil cohomology a system of categories of coefficients and well behaved realization functors, establishing a correspondence between mixed Weil cohomologies and suitable systems of coefficients. The results of this book have already served as ground reference in many subsequent works on motivic sheaves and their realizations, and pointers to the most recent developments of the theory are given in the introduction."
22,Conjecture on the maximum cut and bisection width in random regular graphs,"Asymptotic properties of random regular graphs are object of extensive study in mathematics. In this note we argue, based on theory of spin glasses, that in random regular graphs the maximum cut size asymptotically equals the number of edges in the graph minus the minimum bisection size. Maximum cut and minimal bisection are two famous NP-complete problems with no known general relation between them, hence our conjecture is a surprising property of random regular graphs. We further support the conjecture with numerical simulations. A rigorous proof of this relation is obviously a challenge."
23,MLD Relations of Pisot Substitution Tilings,"We consider 1-dimensional, unimodular Pisot substitution tilings with three intervals, and discuss conditions under which pairs of such tilings are locally isomorhphic (LI), or mutually locally derivable (MDL). For this purpose, we regard the substitutions as homomorphisms of the underlying free group with three generators. Then, if two substitutions are conjugated by an inner automorphism of the free group, the two tilings are LI, and a conjugating outer automorphism between two substitutions can often be used to prove that the two tilings are MLD. We present several examples illustrating the different phenomena that can occur in this context. In particular, we show how two substitution tilings can be MLD even if their substitution matrices are not equal, but only conjugate in $GL(n,\mathbb{Z})$. We also illustrate how the (in our case fractal) windows of MLD tilings can be reconstructed from each other, and discuss how the conjugating group automorphism affects the substitution generating the window boundaries."
24,Spanning forests and the vector bundle Laplacian,"The classical matrix-tree theorem relates the determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian on a graph to the number of spanning trees. We generalize this result to Laplacians on one- and two-dimensional vector bundles, giving a combinatorial interpretation of their determinants in terms of so-called cycle rooted spanning forests (CRSFs). We construct natural measures on CRSFs for which the edges form a determinantal process. This theory gives a natural generalization of the spanning tree process adapted to graphs embedded on surfaces. We give a number of other applications, for example, we compute the probability that a loop-erased random walk on a planar graph between two vertices on the outer boundary passes left of two given faces. This probability cannot be computed using the standard Laplacian alone."
